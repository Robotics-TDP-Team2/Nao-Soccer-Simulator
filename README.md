## [Synopsis](#Nao-Soccer-Simulator)

As a team design project, we aim to develop a set of robust algorithms to simulate Nao humanoid robot autonomously to play soccer. The project involves designing a pipeline for robot manipulation, path planning, perception, and control. The game is supposed to be played between two teams of Nao robots with each team consisting of 4 players.
